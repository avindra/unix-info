`Unix` is a system created somewhere in the 60s when a solution for [timesharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing) became an increasing demand for mainframe machines. It was not uncommon to see ungainly computers that so often completely filled up rooms. They were expensive to build and perhaps even more expensive to maintain. So early on, engineers got to work on solving scheduling algorithms for general compute tasks.

The Unix-style system solves problems not only on single-purpose devices, but on networked groups of machines as well. Unix facilitates the clustering of resources through many apis and utilities. Using the Unix system, one can develop very sophisticated software that remains robust, fast, secure and portable.
