`Unix` is a system created somewhere in the 60s when a solution for [timesharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing) was strongly desired for mainframes. It was not uncommon to see ungainly computers that so often completely filled up rooms. They were expensive to build and perhaps even more expensive to maintain. So very early on, engineers got to work on solving scheduling algorithms for general compute tasks.

The Unix-style system solves problems not only on single-purpose devices, but on networked groups of machines as well. Unix facilitates the clustering of resources through many apis and utilities. Using the Unix system, one can develop very sophisticated software that remains robust, fast, secure and portable.

The distinction between the kernel and the shell paint a very particular use of computing that caters to the user.

In short, this project exists to provide a best-effort attempt to aggregate information about Unix.

## 2020 Briefing

It has been 50 years since the epoch at the time of authorship.

Most people only get a taste for monolithic IBM machines from media such as Stanley Kubrick's `2001: A Space Odyssey`, and may have never registered the term "mainframe" into their regular vocabulary. A datacenter or any kind of cloud-connected resource is conceptually equivalent to the "mainframe." In general, compute resources may be plenty, but need to be shared amongst many users. The solution to this problem turns out time and time again, to be Unix.

Today, Unix is imminently worth knowing because of its <em>ubiquitous</em> deployment around the world. All the major branches of Apple's iOS and MacOS, as well as Linux and Android are designed and integrated around the semantics of the unix system. Also included would be other operating systems derived of Unix such as Solaris (illumos), AIX and every BSD. This includes FreeBSD and NetBSD which are used for example, in consumer-grade routers.

Terminal emulators are a thing. Some wonder what are terminals and why do we emulate them. Answers are contained within.
