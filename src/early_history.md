## Early history

Here are operating systems prior to 1970. Naturally, these are all predecessors of UNIX:

* 1961: [Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatible_Time-Sharing_System), an early timesharing system from MIT
  * first presented in 1962
* 1967: [Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS)](https://github.com/PDP-10/its)
* 1969: [Multics](https://www.multicians.org/general.html)
  * Ken and Dennis were both Multics programmers
  * Considered by some to be too cumbersome and derivate of CTSS to be useful
* 1973: ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMYiktO0D64)) [The Holmdel Computer Center, Part 1](https://techchannel.att.com/playvideo/2012/11/28/AT&T-Archives-Holmdel-Computer-Center-Part-1)
  * Computations as a printout on sheet(s) of paper are placed into the user's bin by an attendant
  * [S/370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/370) (later replaced by [S390](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/390)) was the main timesharing computer
