# Hardware

Much of the original equipment that Unix originally ran on has been decomissioned.

Some of the original systems are still in use, especially in cases where architectural successors exist (e.g., on the IBM S/370 line).

## Emulators

Here are emulators for various systems that Unix was developed or used on.

 * [SimH emulator](http://simh.trailing-edge.com/)
 * [DEC Emulation](http://www.avanthar.com/healyzh/decemulation/decemu.html)
 * [Hercules](http://www.hercules-390.eu/)
   - S/370, ESA/390 and z/Arch
 * [freebee](https://github.com/philpem/freebee)
   - 1985 AT&T UNIX PC (3B1)
 * [In-Browser pdp-11 emulator](https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11.html)
   * [source code](https://github.com/paulnank/nankervis-pdp11-js)
   * has UNIX image. Look for `boot rk0` to see how to load from disk and invoke login
