## Programming languages

Unix featured use of multiple high-level programming languages. As development went on, more of the code was written in a high level programming language over time. This can be observered in the [source code video](./../source_code.md).

Although not an easy feat, Unix enjoyed portability in its implementation using mostly a high level language, namely `C`.
