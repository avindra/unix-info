# Shell

The Shell is a type of [command language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_language), an interface to the operating system and a means for the user to control the kernel. Multiple shells have seen use since early UNIX days, and still more shells are being developed today.

Shell languages often mix structured programming with bespoke commands like [`cd`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)#Implementations) command, which every shell MUST implement since `chdir` can only affect the working directory of the running process itself.
