# Hardware

Much of the equipment that Unix originally ran on has been decommissioned (i.e., put out of use). Some original systems are still in use, especially in cases where architectural successors exist (e.g., on the IBM S/370 line).

It is possible now to run Ancient UNIX editions via a number of emulation software.

## Emulators

Here are emulators for various systems that Unix was developed or used on.

 * [SimH emulator](http://simh.trailing-edge.com/)
 * [DEC Emulation](http://www.avanthar.com/healyzh/decemulation/decemu.html)
 * [Hercules](http://www.hercules-390.eu/)
   - S/370, ESA/390 and z/Arch
 * [freebee](https://github.com/philpem/freebee)
   - 1985 AT&T UNIX PC (3B1)
 * [pdp-11 emulator (JS/Web)](https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11.html)
   * by Paul Nankervis
   * [source code](https://github.com/paulnank/nankervis-pdp11-js)
   * has UNIX image. Look for `boot rk0` to see how to load from disk and invoke login
 * [pdp-11 emulator (JS/Web)](http://pdp11.aiju.de/)

## Emulation milestones

 * 2019: [LCM+L PDP-7 booting and running UNIX Version 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvaPaWyiuLA)
 * 2020: [Space Travel game emulated on PDP-7 UNIX](./code/pdp7.md)

## Models

See the [DEC Documentation Archive](http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/) for manuals and information about peripherals.
