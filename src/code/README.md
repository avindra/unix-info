Unix has been ported to Git repository featuring multiple branches and accurately timestamped git commits.
If you want to know more about the project and the archaeological effort to recreate Unix in git, see [Dr. Spinellis's 2016 document "A Repository of Unix History and Evolution"](https://www.spinellis.gr/pubs/jrnl/2016-EMPSE-unix-history/html/unix-history.html). A [2015 edition](https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Documentation/Papers/Spi15c.pdf), titled "A Repository with 44 Years of Unix Evolution" is also available.

## Visualization

Here is a run of the synthesized Unix repo through [Gource](https://gource.io/), which helps us to imagine what the development of Unix might have looked like. The following run captures only the history from 1972 - 1985.

After 1980 the tree becomes quite complex. Crucially, the [Bell System](/prim/bell.md) was broken up over 1982-1984, and the final [release of research UNIX](https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/RELEASE_DATES) was the 10th edition in 1989.
