## Programming languages

UNIX featured use of multiple high-level programming languages. As development went on, more of the code was written in a high level programming language over time. You can view this evolution and witness C slowly take over in the [source code video](./../code).

Although not an easy feat, UNIX eventually enjoyed portability in its implementation using mostly high level languages. Namely, [the C programming language](./C.md) was eventually used to implement most of UNIX and it's various utilities, rather than an assembler language.

All UNIX users will encounter a [shell](./shell.md) language, as it is typically the main interface to the OS.

### General

The code samples from Kernighan's talks tend to use [C](./C.md) and [AWK](./awk.md).
