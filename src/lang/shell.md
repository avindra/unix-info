# Shell

The Shell is a special language, in that it is an interface to the operating system and a means for a the user to control the kernel. Multiple shells have seen use since early UNIX days, and still more shells are being developed today.

Shell languages often mix structured programming with unique commands that only make sense in the context of the shell.
