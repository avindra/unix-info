# Introduction

`Unix` is a system created somewhere in the 60s when a solution for [time-sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing) was desired for mainframes. A datacenter can be viewed as the imminent allegory of the 'mainframe'. Terminal emulators are still around, and if you want to know why, it helps to know the history.

The Unix-style system has been shown to solve problems single-purpose devices, "server farm" type compute centers, and more. It is imminently worth knowing because of its ubiquitous deployment around the world.

This project exists to provide a best-effort attempt to aggregate information about Unix.
