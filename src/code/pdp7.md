## PDP-7 source

One of the earliest complete versions of UNIX ran on the PDP-7. There is now a Github repository that seeks to resurrect specifically the pdp7 version of UNIX:

[https://github.com/DoctorWkt/pdp7-unix](https://github.com/DoctorWkt/pdp7-unix)


It includes a version of Ken Thompson's [space travel game](https://github.com/DoctorWkt/pdp7-unix/blob/master/src/cmd/st1.s) that is sometimes described as the impetus for UNIX.
