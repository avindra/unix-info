### C

C is a programming language that was the primary language used in UNIX systems since the epoch.

Today, programmers use languages like C++, Rust and [Go](./go.md) in addition to C. C still enjoys use on modern UNIX systems and in embedded settings.

## B

For completeness sake, there briefly existed a language called B which was later superseded by C. Here is some B literature:
