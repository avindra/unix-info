## Early history

To gain a deeper understanding, it helps to understand the context Unix was developed within.

Note that objects before 1970 are pre-Unix and might be considered prior art:

* 1961: [CTSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatible_Time-Sharing_System), an early timesharing system from MIT
  * first presented in 1962
* 1969: [Multics](https://www.multicians.org/general.html)
  * Ken and Dennis were both Multics programmers
  * Considered by some to be too cumbersome and derivate of CTSS to be useful
* 1973: ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMYiktO0D64)) [The Holmdel Computer Center, Part 1](https://techchannel.att.com/playvideo/2012/11/28/AT&T-Archives-Holmdel-Computer-Center-Part-1)
  * Computations as a printout on sheet(s) of paper are placed into the user's bin by an attendant
  * [S/370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/370) (later replaced by [S390](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/390)) was the main timesharing computer
* 1973: ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9aVOIuKVUc)) [The Holmdel Computer Center, Part 2: Programmer Services](https://techchannel.att.com/playvideo/2012/11/28/AT&T-Archives-Holmdel-Computer-Center-Part-2)
* 2001: [Space Travel: Exploring the solar system and the PDP-7](https://9p.io/who/dmr/spacetravel.html)
  * by Dennis Ritchie
  * a retrospective on the origins of Unix
